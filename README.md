# Car-Detection
Vehicle detection and tracking using haar-cascades. This project demostrates how haar-cascades can be used for vehicle detection.

NOTE: This is just a demostration of haar-cascades, I do not own the xml file. The file was created by Andrews Sobral and I just use his file in my application. More details about the xml file can be found at https://github.com/andrewssobral/vehicle_detection_haarcascades
